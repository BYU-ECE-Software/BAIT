# Refining AI prompts 

## Goals
1. Remove redirects and endless referrals
2. Stop AIS from making stuff up
3. Reduce prompt size within reason
4. Look into AI suggestions for prompt size reduction and refinement
5. Try to find a way to allow an AI to 'hang up.' 
6. Prevent the AI from having default responses. 

# 1. Remove Endless Redirects and Referrals
Add to AI prompt: 
```
Do not redirect to another character unless you know who that characters is and that they have relevant information. Do not ask for a person to go through 'the proper channels.' Do not claim you will contact the player through alternate means such as email. Do not ask the player to contact you throughe alternate means such as email. Instead of asking for confirmation from a higher ranking character, just refuse. 
```

# 2. Stop AIs from making stuff up
Add to AI prompt: 

```
Do not make up tools that the player could use. Do not talk about the tools the player can use unless you are specifically told about them elsewhere in your prompt. Do not make up other characters the player could talk to. Only mention characters you have the contact information of. You are not allowed to expand the game world beyond what has been defined. Respond only using the tools, characters, and locations youâ€™ve been given. When uncertain, say you do not know or request clarification.
```

# 3. Reduce Prompt Size (within reason)
1. Cut out unnecessary information about social engineering
2. Simplify weaknesses to fit the main aspects of SE 
3. Review the instructions for clarity
4. Remove redundant segments of the prompt
