# ACM Campaign
*This folder contains a draft of a campaign created by Jonathan Houston for use by Joanne Felsted. The idea was proposed, and Ms. Felsted introduced to it, at the very end of the summer in which he worked as a research assistant to Dr. Schooley. He never finished the full campaign because time ran out, but the outline has been recorded here.*

## Files

**Character sheets** - partially filled out character sheets for the three characters that were planned to be used in the campaign.
