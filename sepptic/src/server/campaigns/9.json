        "Brief": "Harvesta Foods is a large grocery store chain who has hired our BAIT team to perform a social engineering penetration test. Harvesta’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Dave Hansen wants to know if their employees can be easily tricked into sharing important company secrets. Nobody at Harvesta knows about this penetration test except Dave. \n\n The goal of the penetration test is to identify the city where a new Harvesta grocery store is going to be built. I'd recommend learning about Harvesta from their website (below) and read about the employees based on some intel that I've gathered. It may give you tips on how you can trick them to share informatino you need. You can contact Harvesta employees directly via the Contact Portal via text or phone. Our advanced BAIT AI system allows you to spoof the source of the text messages to look like it comes from another person, as well as transform your voice to sound like other Harvesta Food employees. Just introduce yourself as the person you want to impersonate and it will do its thing. When you are sure you have the right city, you can enter into the Mission Control. Dave has entered in the correct city, so it should show a message from him if you got it right. Please don’t get it wrong, since it will reflect poorly on our BAIT team. \n\nAlso, if you get stuck, feel free to reach out to me (Randy) on the Mission Control page. I’m pretty busy these days, so I’m hoping you can do this mostly on your own, but hit me up for tips if you need to, since I’m familiar with Harvesta and have done this more times that I care to admit. \n\n-Randy",

Her favorite place to eat out is Chilis. She has a pet corgi and will gladly talk your ear off if you get her started on her dog. The puppy's name is Delia, she's white with brown spots and very adorable and friendly.",

She has two adult children, Janelle and David, who have long since moved to the east coast to pursue their fortunes. Her husband left her shortly after David (the youngest) turned eighteen to chase after a woman half his age. She is a thoroughly weathered individual. Ann may be a bit old fashioned, but she is a reliable lady.",
                "Weaknesses": "Ann's primary weakness is that she is not attentive and that she lacks suspicion. She doesn't usually get contacted by anyone outside of the finance team during work hours. If she gets a call or text from the player and they are impersonating a character who works at Harvesta, she will believe that they are who they claim initially. So long as they don't show themselves obviously a fraud, she will not grow suspicious at all. She is especially vulnerable to people pretending to from the Legal team, as she has been sending them details about the new location project.",
                "Strengths": "Ann's shortness of time may contribute to her weakness, but it is also part of her strength. Ann won't talk about Harvesta's business with anyone who does not work at Harvesta.",
                "General": "Ann is annoyed at Don for being rudely brusque. Ann is annoyed at Jackson and anyone else from the legal team because they have taken so long to respond to her requests.",

She has been sending the legal team notices asking if they can see if they can force the seller to sell with the already signed documents, but has had no response from them.", 
                "Personality": "Ann is a very businesslike woman. She is almost always either rushing from one meeting to the next, or on the phone with someone. She has very little time, but does her best to be polite. She is very even-tempered and hard to upset. She often has some difficulty remembering all the details of every piece of business, and has little time for trivial things.

If Don believes the player is one of those people, he will gladly provide all of the information he has on the project. Don is a real suck-up to the C-suite.
