# Potential Improvements

**As of August 2025, we now track some future changes and improvements under the projects tab of the repository as well**

This file is a list of any improvements that we think would be beneficial to the project. They are in no particular order, and are some things we noticed or wanted to do.

- Security character/potential to be caught: Add a persona that is suspicious of social engineering, if you fail to get information right away they kick you out. Or, make every persona like this. Or, an idea that we tried was make a security character, personas can report you to security if they feel you are being suspicious, then you have to social engineer the security persona to let you out.
- Survey that is local to the website: Instead of having a Qualtrics survey, create a dedicated page on the site that is the survey, responses can be saved in the DB.
- Add loading icon to messaging between request and response: Add a spinny wheel or something that shows when the site is waiting for a response from the AI. Currently, nothing happens when you click send, and many users will spam the send button, sending multiple empty prompts to the AI. With the loading icon, hopefully users will realize that they don't need to click send again.
- Better state: Work on making more of the site stateful, so that users don't have to refresh to see changes. Specifically the admin panel
- Explain the project better within the site: Essentially, allow the project to stand on its own, not requiring a presentation/explanation for users to understand what the project is and what to do. This could likely come in the form of a much more detailed about page
