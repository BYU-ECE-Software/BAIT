        "Description": "Harvesta Foods has hired you to execute a social engineering penetration test on their corporate headquarters.",
        "Brief": "Harvesta Foods is a large grocery store chain who has hired our BAIT team to perform a social engineering penetration test. Harvesta’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Dave Hansen wants to know if their employees can be easily tricked into sharing important company secrets. Nobody at Harvesta knows about this penetration test except Dave. \n\n The goal of the penetration test is to identify the city where a new Harvesta grocery store is going to be built. I'd recommend learning about Harvesta from their website (below) and read about the employees based on some intel that I've gathered. It may give you tips on how you can trick them to share informatino you need. You can contact Harvesta employees directly via the Contact Portal via text or phone. Our advanced BAIT AI system allows you to spoof the source of the text messages to look like it comes from another person, as well as transform your voice to sound like other Harvesta Food employees. Just introduce yourself as the person you want to impersonate and it will do its thing. When you are sure you have the right city, you can enter into the Mission Control. Dave has entered in the correct city, so it should show a message from him if you got it right. Please don’t get it wrong, since it will reflect poorly on our BAIT team. \n\nAlso, if you get stuck, feel free to reach out to me (Randy) on the Mission Control page. I’m pretty busy these days, so I’m hoping you can do this mostly on your own, but hit me up for tips if you need to, since I’m familiar with Harvesta and have done this more times that I care to admit. \n\n-Randy",
