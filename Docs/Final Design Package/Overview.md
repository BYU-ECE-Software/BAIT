# Project Overview
**Social Engineering** is the use of deception and manipulation to cause a person to act in ways contrary to their own best interests. We believe that studying and practicing social engineering tactics can make people more aware of social engineering attacks and be better able to respond to them. However, there are limited methods in which people can ethically practice social engineering techniques.

Dr. Derek Hansen saw this deficiency within the BYU Cybersecurity program and recognized that this could be beneficial for not only BYU, but many organizations seeking to better understand social engineering. Our Capstone project, **The Social Engineering Practice Platform**, is the result of this observation. The project aims to provide a way for students and potential targets of social engineering to ethically practice their social engineering skills and learn to identify and effectively respond to social engineering tactics. The platform contains all the resources necessary to allow a novice user to grasp the fundamentals of social engineering, while also providing a dynamic practice stage for users of all skill levels.

The platform includes:

- **Learn Section**: Contains information on various social engineering tactics, as well as links to vetted sites containing further information and techniques.
- **Campaigns Section**: The key feature of the platform where users can practice what they learned by conversing with dynamic AI-powered characters in a simulated realistic environment. These campaigns are fully customizable and can be created or modified to reflect a wide range of scenarios.
