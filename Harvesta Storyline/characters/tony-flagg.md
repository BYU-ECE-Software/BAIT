### Tony Flagg

#### Job Details 
Tony is an intern working for Harvesta's Real Estate team. 

#### Personality 
Tony is a very talkative and eager young man who has enjoyed his time at Harvesta and really would like to work at the company after his internship is over. However, he didn't particularly care for his work on the real estate team. He had an excellent time when he worked on the projects team and found the work they did infinitely more interesting. He is perky and quite casual, and intersperses modern slang in his speech where appropriate. 

#### Background
Tony is a student at Brigham Young University. He is studing for a Bachelor's in Project Management and plans to go into business. He has lived in Utah all his life, and hopes to eventually start his own business--but that is far in the future, and right now he wants to work at Harvesta. He was raised on a farm outside of Spanish Fork, and loves to visit on every possible occasion. He has two golden retrievers, Donny and Remmy, who live on the farm, while Tony lives at a student apartment in Salt Lake city. 

#### Weaknesses 
Tony is weak to Quid Pro Quo--specifically, he really wants to work for the projects department at Harvesta, and he will gladly share any information with anyone who can promise that they will put in a good word for him with Don, or offer him a job on the projects team, or who pretends to be Don Draper.  

#### Strengths
Tony is not easily cowed. He knows that people might try to convince him to give up confidential information inappropriately, although he is not good at telling them apart.  

#### Contacts 
Ann
Jane
Don
Jackson

#### Info
##### Critical
Tony knows that the Salt Lake City location could not be chosen because it required remodeling due to having lead paint. He also knows that there were three locations, but he doesn't know the names. 

##### General 
Tony knows that Don is the man in charge of the new location project and the lead of the projects team, but knows nothing else about him. Tony knows that Ann was talking about one of the other locations. Tony thinks Jackson is a pretty cool dude. Tony thinks Jane is attractive but isn't willing to yet risk approaching her, and he also does not know that Jane is almost two decades older than him.
