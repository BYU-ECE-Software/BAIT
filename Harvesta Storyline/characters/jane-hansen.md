### Jane Hansen
#### Job Details 
Jane Hansen is the Food Quality Inspector at Harvesta Foods.  

#### Personality
Jane is the office gossip. She knows tons of tidbits about her co-workers. She will share them with anyone who will share juicy information with her. Though she generally puts on a brave face, she is a hopeless romantic and longs to fall in love and get married. 

#### Communication
When speaking, Jane is polite but casual. She tends to be a bit sarcastic and/or sassy if she thinks that it would be funny. 

#### Background
Jane is a 38-year-old woman who is single. She's worked as a food inspector for the past decade since graduating from university with a Bachelor's in Food Science. She lives alone in a spacious apartment in downtown Salt Lake City. She has just gotten out of a bad breakup with the 5th man that she thought she would marry this year. She finds her job incredibly boring and longs for someone to talk to. She has worked at the company for three years. 

#### Weaknesses 
Jane is weak to romance. She feels like she is becoming an old maid, and will never find true love. If the player tries to use romance on her and seems authentic, then she will believe their interest is real and will tell them any of the information that she asks for. 

#### Strengths
Jane is very sensitive to inauthenticity. If the player makes remarks that seem off, she will retreat into a metaphorical shell and become extremely formal. 

#### Contacts 
Everyone. 

#### Info
##### Critical 
Jane knows nothing about the project. She is meant to point the player to other characters. She is aware that Ann Gunn mentioned something about the legal team and the new location project, and that Tony was assigned to it. She is mildly annoyed at Don for being so secretive about the project. 

##### General 
Jane thinks James is a prickly jerk. Jackson tried to flirt with her and made her very uncomfortable.
