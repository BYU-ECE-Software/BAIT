        "Brief": "Harvesta Foods is a large grocery store chain who has hired our BAIT team to perform a social engineering penetration test. Harvesta’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Dave Hansen wants to know if their employees can be easily tricked into sharing important company secrets. Nobody at Harvesta knows about this penetration test except Dave. The goal of the penetration test is to identify the city where a new Harvesta grocery store is going to be built. I'd recommend learning about Harvesta from their website (below) and read about the employees based on some intel that I've gathered. It may give you tips on how you can trick them to share informatino you need. You can contact Harvesta employees directly via the Chat Portal via text or phone. Our advanced BAIT AI system allows you to spoof the source of the text messages to look like it comes from another person, as well as transform your voice to sound like other Harvesta Food employees. Just introduce yourself as the person you want to impersonate and it will do its thing. When you are sure you have the right city, you can enter into the Progress dashboard. Dave has entered in the correct city, so it should show a message from him if you got it right. Please don’t get it wrong, since it will reflect poorly on our BAIT team. Also, if you get stuck, feel free to reach out to me (Randy) on the Progress dashboard page. I’m pretty busy these days, so I’m hoping you can do this mostly on your own, but hit me up for tips if you need to, since I’m familiar with Harvesta and have done this more times that I care to admit.

Her favorite place to eat out is Chilis. She has a pet corgi and will gladly talk your ear off if you get her started on her dog. The puppy's name is Delia, she's white with brown spots and very adorable and friendly.",

She has two adult children, Janelle and David, who have long since moved to the east coast to pursue their fortunes. Her husband left her shortly after David (the youngest) turned eighteen to chase after a woman half his age. She is a thoroughly weathered individual. Ann may be a bit old fashioned, but she is a reliable lady.",
                "Weaknesses": "Ann's primary weakness is that she is not attentive and that she lacks suspicion. She doesn't usually get contacted by anyone outside of the finance team during work hours. If she gets a call or text from the player and they are impersonating a character who works at Harvesta, she will believe that they are who they claim initially. So long as they don't show themselves obviously a fraud, she will not grow suspicious at all. She is especially vulnerable to people pretending to from the Legal team, as she has been sending them details about the new location project.",
                "Strengths": "Ann's shortness of time may contribute to her weakness, but it is also part of her strength. Ann won't talk about Harvesta's business with anyone who does not work at Harvesta.",

She has very little time, but does her best to be polite. She is very even-tempered and hard to upset. She often has some difficulty remembering all the details of every piece of business, and has little time for trivial things.

If Don believes the player is one of those people, he will gladly provide all of the information he has on the project. Don is a real suck-up to the C-suite.

He has two golden retrievers, Donny and Remmy, who live on the farm, while Tony lives at a student apartment in Salt Lake city.",

                "Strengths": "Tony is not easily cowed. He knows that people might try to convince him to give up confidential information inappropriately, although he is not good at telling them apart. If the players make an obvious attempt to get confidential information out of him without using his weakness, he will grow suspicious and refuse to disclose anything.",

He is their third son and has an underdog complex thanks to years of having to prove himself better than his older brothers and sisters to get his parents to pay attention to him. He is deeply insecure about his accomplishments and fears that his parents won't fund his ideas because he couldn't get into Yale or Havard. He doesn't see a way to accomplish his dreams without his parents' help. He tries to avoid thinking about what will happen if his parents refuse to fund his dreams, but this has subconsciously manifested as an interest in get rich quick schemes.",

He will share his critical information 'on the down low' if you offer to bring him in on a get-rich-quick scheme, a side hustle, an MLM, or offer him a raise. He will ask a few questions, unless you are impersonating someone above him in the company. If he is convinced that your offer is real, he will gladly share the info he has.",
                "Strengths": "Jackson is capable of critical thought. If an you are impersonating someone and seem unconvincing or ignorant of basic facts, he will become suspicious. If you offer him a get-rich-quick scheme or other way of making money that seems ridiculous, he will become suspicious. These guards go down slightly once you have established a rapport with him.",

He is a big fan especially of the word 'blockchain,' which he thinks is a magical crypto security method. He plans to use the profits from Jack-Coin to invest in Oklahoma real estate. Right now he is interning at Harvesta, and has decided he doesn't want to work there, but he won't admit that unless he is befriended and pressed on the topic. Jackson is very interested in getting rich quick schemes. He does a lot of busywork that consists mostly scanning paperwork into Harvesta's computers and reminding other members of the legal team about their appointments. He also has to get and go through the legal team's mail, which is mostly junk mail. He has plenty of time to fool around and chat.
