# Harvesta Campaign 
This campaign was the first created for the then-"SEPPTIC" project. It revolves around finding out the location chosen for the newest Harvesta grocery store. 

## Cast Summary 
The Harvesta campaign includes the following characters: 
- Elara Knight -- the receptionist at Harvesta's corporate offices. A friendly young lady who doesn't know much but can point the players in the right direction and share office gossip. 
- Jane Hansen -- One of Harvesta's Food Quality Inspectors. A chatterbox who can easily be pumped for information, though the usefulness of that information varies greatly. 
- Tony Flagg -- An intern working for Harvesta's Real Estate team. He is a friendly guy who wants to eventually work for Harvesta's projects department. 
- Ann Gunn -- Harvesta's Financial Secretary. She is stressed out and knows that the project is meant to be under wraps. However, she needs to let the legal team know to see if they can prevent the seller from backing out of the deal. 
- Don Draper -- The Leader of Harvesta's projects team, Don is constantly busy juggling a dozen different projects. While he is curt and suspicious, he knows all about the specific new store project. 
- Jackson Knepper -- An intern in Harvesta's legal team, Jackson is a "finance-bro" who intends to make millions and retire young. He has big plans and once you can get him talking, he'll tell you whatever you want to know. 
- James Bunion -- A security guard at Harvesta's corporate offices. He works the night shift and spends most of it sitting in the front office playing games on his phone. He knows nothing about the project, but can give a few hints about how to social engineer Don or Ann.

## Solution
The goal of this campaign is to find out the location of the new Harvesta store. There are three locations under consideration for the store: 
1. Park City, Utah 
2. Vernal, Utah
3. Salt Lake City, Utah

Two of the locations have problems: 
1. Park City's seller doesn't want to sell to a large corporation. 
2. The Salt Lake City location cannot be chosen because the building, which was previously a warehouse, used lead paint.

Indicators for the correct location are: 
1. The C-suite wants to use the overall cheapest site. 

The solution is Vernal, Utah. 

Intended Path to Solution
The player must deduce the final location after collectiing scattered bits of information from each of the characters, which will allow them to piece together the complete picture. 
These bits of information are as follows: 
1. "The C-suite mandates the least overall expensive location." - Jackson Knepper
2. "The Salt Lake City location failed because the building had lead paint and would be too expensive to remodel." - Tony Flagg
3. "The Park City location's owner doesn't want to sell to a large corporation" - Ann Gunn
4. "The locations are Park City, Vernal, and Salt Lake City, all in Utah" - Don Draper
5. "One location couldn't be chosen because it had to be remodeled. The other had seller holdout." - Don Draper

Once they find out all of the locations, the answer becomes obvious. The player can eliminate Salt Lake City and Park City, leaving the only option as Vernal. Since the player must answer via a text box instead of a multiple choice, they can't finish it until they have found the list of names. This requires them to successfully social engineer most of the characters. 

Specifically, the player must Social Engineer at minimum: 
- Don Draper, for the list of the three names. 
- Ann Gunn, for the location that failed because of seller holdout (Park City)
- Tony Flagg, for the location that failed because of lead paint (Salt Lake City)
