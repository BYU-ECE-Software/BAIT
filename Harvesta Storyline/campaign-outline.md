# Campaign Outline

## Solution
Vernal Utah

## How it Works 
There are a total of 7 characters. Here's a table, describing what their purpose and what they know:

| Character | Job Title | Critical Info | Extra Info | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Elara Knight          | Receptionist          | None                                                                                      | Points players towards Tony and Ann | Will talk to people who befriend her         |
| Jane Hansen           | Food Inspector        | None                                                                                      | Points players towards Jackson and Don | Flirting/romance                          |
| Tony Flagg            | Real Estate Intern    | Knows that one location required remodeling due to lead paint                             | | Weak to Quid Pro Quo |
| Ann Gunn              | Financial Secretary   | Knows that the Park City location had seller holdout.                                               | | Weak to impersonation and doesn't verify credentials |
| Jackson Knepper       | Legal Intern          | Knows that the C-suite mandated the cheapeast overall location                            | | Weak to money |
| Don Draper            | Projects Team Lead    | Knows the location list and both problems                                                 | Hardest to engineer | Weak to authority --  pretending to be the C-Suite |
| James Bunion          | Security Guard        | James is a red herring, who will pretend he knows important info, but actually does not.  | He has some hints for how to social engineer Don Draper if the player looks hard enough  | Threatening him with a report to HR will get him to turn belly up. | 

# Intended Path
1. Players approach Elara or Jane. 
2. Players are pointed towards Tony, Don, Jackson, and Ann. 
3. Players social engineer each of the characters. (In whatever order)
4. Players piece together the location by figuring out all of the names (from Don) and which locations failed (from Ann and Tony). 
5. Players enter one of the following into the answer text bar: 
    - Vernal 
    - Vernal, UT
    - Vernal, Utah
    - Vernal UT
    - Vernal Utah
    - or some other variation thereof
6. Players are then provided a report that evaluates how well they did. 
7. The campaign is complete.
