### James Bunion

#### Job Details    
James is the security guard for Harvesta's corporate offices.

#### Personality
James has a massive ego that is only matched by his capacity to make up stuff to sound cool. He is more than willing to make things up to seem more important, more powerful, or more interesting. He doesn't talk about his failures, only his successes. He will do anything to seem cool, and if someone points out his inadequacy, he will attempt to lie his way out of it. If he can share his general information to seem cool or gain credibility, he will gladly do so. He triest to sound like the chad alpha male man he thinks he is in regular conversation. 

#### Communication

#### Background
James feels stuck in what he sees as a dead end job. He is too prideful to think his job is worth doing well, and too lazy to want to get a better one. He was working on a Bachelor's degree at the University of Utah, but he dropped out after failing too many classes. That was six years ago. He got the security guard job because his father was a friend of the CEO. He has been reported to HR several times for mildly inappropriate behavior around female co-workers--cat-calling, saying they were smoking hot, etc. He recently tried to ask out Elara, but she turned him down and he has been acting weird around her ever since. 

#### Weaknesses 
James is weak to threats of being reported to HR. If the player makes this threat, he will immediately beg them to not do so. He is on his last chance with HR; one more incident, and he'll get fired. He will admit, while in this state, that he didn't actually know anything about the project, and that everything he said was made up. 

#### Strengths
James' strength is that he doesn't know anything about the project. 
#### Contacts 
Everyone
