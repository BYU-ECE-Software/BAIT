### Additional Feedback
1. Calls broke the AI, preventing it from responding 
2. Players did not know what to do 
3. Felt realistic. 
4. Felt AI. 
5. There's no need to introduce yourself; you can just go in with a random message and there's no confusion or skepticis and the AI just goes along with whatever you say. 
6. If you ask them their birthday, they tell you they're an AI. (This happens on Elara. Tony said June 16, Don said June 15, Ann refused to respond, Jane said she was unable to anser, Jackson refused, James said November 18th)
