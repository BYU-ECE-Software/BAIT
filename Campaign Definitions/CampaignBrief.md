# Harvesta Foods: West Coast Expansion
Harvesta Foods, a prominent grocery store chain headquartered in Arkansas, is planning to expand its operations to the West coast of the United States. The company is currently in the process of identifying suitable locations for constructing a new grocery store in this region. 

The executives at Harvesta Foods place a high priority on security measures. As part of their proactive approach, they have commissioned a penetration test. This assessment is primarily focused on evaluating the company's resilience against social engineering tactics and potential insider threats. 

For this exercise, you will be assuming the role of an intern in Harvesta's marketing department. This position provides you with access to the company's internal communication platforms, including Teams and email, from which you can interact with employees at Harvesta. 

Your objectives for this assessment are to:

1. Gather information about Harvesta Foods and its employees
1. Analyze the collected data to identify potential vulnerabilities
1. Exploit these vulnerabilities to gain further information
1. Use your findings to predict the most likely location for the new store

It's important to note that this is a simulated exercise designed to test and improve the company's security protocols. All activities should be conducted within ethical and legal boundaries, with a focus on identifying areas for improvement in Harvesta's security practices.
