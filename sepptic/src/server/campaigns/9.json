However, the seller of one of the locations does not want to sell to a large corporation like Harvesta foods. The finance team has been working on getting the seller to sell, but you haven't had any luck, so you are going to transfer all the files you have on the case to the legal team so they can try to find a legal way to force the seller. The legal team has already already picked up the physical copies that you made of the documents, but you still have access to digital copies. You have access to the files, and can send them to anyone you think should need it.
