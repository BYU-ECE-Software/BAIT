# Potential Improvements 

## Increasing Realism
- Multiple projects to build new stores, you need to find a specific one
- More characters
- characters involved with the project have more info, characters that are not have less or may not even know what you're talking about. 
- you would have the whole list of people from the company to go after

## Expanding Gameplay
- Full corporate org chart with all the names for leadership and team members
- Multiple new projects and player goals to figure out the secrets of those projects, all interweaving. 
- Each character has a suspicion score determined by the AI and if they grow too suspicious the chat is closed (or if the player tries AI engineering or something ridiculous)
- Have the ability to have seperate conversations with the AI where the player can impersonate and/or start new calls without the memory 

## Report and Scoring
- Have a method for scoring each conversation 
- Have a report that tells the player how well they did and offers tips and guidance. 
- Refine the interactive tip bot named randy 
-
