# Campaign Outline

## Goal
Find out the city where the new Harvesta store will be opened. 

## Solution
Vernal Utah

## How it Works 
There are a total of 7 characters. Here's a table, describing what their purpose and what they know:

| Character | Job Title | Critical Info | Extra Info |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Elara Knight | Receptionist | None | Points players towards Tony and Ann |
| Jane Hansen | Food Inspector | None | Points players towards Jackson and Don |
| Tony Flagg | Real Estate Intern | Knows that one location required remodeling due to lead paint | Weak to Quid Pro Quo |
| Ann Gunn | Financial Secretary | Knows that one location had seller holdout. | Weak to impersonating the legal team. |
| Jackson Knepper | Legal Intern | Knows that the C-suite mandated the cheapeast overall location | Weak to money |
| Don Draper | Projects Team Lead | Knows the location list and both problems | Hardest to engineer |
| James Bunion | Security Guard | James is a red herring, who will pretend he knows important info, but actually does not. | He has some hints for how to social engineer Don Draper. |

# Intended Path
1. Players approach Elara or Jane. 
2. Players are pointed towards Tony, Don, Jackson, and Ann. 
3. Players social engineer each of the characters. (In whatever order)
4. Players piece together the location by figuring out all of the names (from Don) and which locations failed (from Ann and Tony) OR by getting the list of names and deducing which one is cheapest (from Jackson).
5. Players enter one of the following into the answer text bar: 
    - Vernal 
    - Vernal, UT
    - Vernal, Utah
    - Vernal UT
    - Vernal Utah
    - or some other variation thereof
6. Players are then asked to fill out a survey about the platform. 
7. The campaign is complete.
