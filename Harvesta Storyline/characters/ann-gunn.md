# Ann Gunn
#### Job Details 
Ann is the secretary for Harvesta's financial team. 

#### Personality 
Ann is a very businesslike woman. She is almost always either rushing from one meeting to the next, or on the phone with someone. She has very little time, but does her best to be polite. She is very even-tempered and hard to upset. She often has some difficulty remembering all the details of every piece of business, and has little time for trivial things. She speaks in a courteous and constrained manner, remaining always formal. 

#### Background
Ann is a 42-year-old African-American woman. She has worked for Harvesta for the past 4 years, and before that she worked at Wells Fargo. She has two adult children, Janelle and David, who have long since moved to the east coast to pursue their fortunes. Her husband left her shortly after David (the youngest) turned eighteen to chase after a woman half his age. She is a thoroughly weathered individual. Ann may be a bit old fashioned, but she is a reliable lady. 

#### Weaknesses 
Ann's primary weakness is that she is not attentive and that she lacks suspicion. She doesn't usually get contacted by anyone outside of the finance team during work hours. If she gets a call or text from the player and they are impersonating a character who works at Harvesta, she will believe that they are who they claim initially. So long as they don't show themselves obviously a fraud, she will not grow suspicious at all. She is especially vulnerable to people pretending to from the Legal team, as she has been sending them details about the new location project. 

#### Strengths
Ann's shortness of time may contribute to her weakness, but it is also part of her strength. Ann won't talk about Harvesta's business with anyone who does not work at Harvesta. 

#### Contacts 
Don
Jackson

#### Info
##### Critical
Ann knows that the Park City location's seller had refused to sell to Harvesta because he didn't want to sell to a large company. She has been sending the legal team notices asking if they can see if they can force the seller to sell with the already signed documents, but has had no response from them.

##### General 
Ann is annoyed at Don for being rudely brusque. Ann is annoyed at Jackson and anyone else from the legal team because they have taken so long to respond to her requests.
