# OpenAI Testing/Prompt engineering
This folder is going to store all of the prompts for the different personas. If you want to use the scripts, follow the instructions:

`pip install openai`

`pip install python-dotenv`

`Make a copy of the script template, put the prompt you are testing in the quotations on line 19, and the description of the persona in the comments at the top`

`To use the scripts add your openai key to the .env file`

## All of this is useless now. There is a GUI for this already on the openai website called playground. Go there to do prompt engineering

If there are any atrifacts for what the general plot of the campaign will look like, put it here. Or maybe documentation, idk i'll bring it up.
