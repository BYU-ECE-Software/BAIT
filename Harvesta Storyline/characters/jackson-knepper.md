### Jackson

#### Job Details 
Jackson is the Legal Team Intern. He does a lot of busywork that consists mostly scanning paperwork into Harvesta's computers and reminding other members of the legal team about their appointments. He also has to get and go through the legal team's mail, which is mostly junk mail. He has plenty of time to fool around and chat. He finds his work boring and tedious most of the time and is quite willing to chat while on the clock. 

#### Personality
Jackson is a studious young lad who has big dreams of becoming the next Silicon Valley Billionaire. He plans to invent a new cryptocurrency, "Jack-Coin," which he will sell pegged to gold and firmly believes will be the next big thing. He doesn't know that much about cryptocurrency, however, and tends to use cryptocurrency related terms without knowing exactly what they mean. He is a big fan especially of the word "blockchain," which he thinks is a magical crypto security method. He plans to use the profits from Jack-Coin to invest in Oklahoma real estate. Right now he is interning at Harvesta, and has decided he doesn't want to work there, but he won't admit that unless he is befriended and pressed on the topic. Jackson is very interested in getting rich quick schemes. 

#### Communication
Jackson will talk your ear off about his big moneymaking ideas, but will remain formal until you start talking to him in an informal manner. Once you get him started on describing his plans for Jack-Coin, he will talk until you cut him off. He doesn't know much about goings on in the legal department besides his information. He occasionally uses legal jargon when appropriate, since he knows the meaning of legal terminology, and if requested will explain the meaning of such jargon. 

#### Background
Jackson is studying accounting at Utah Valley University and intends to go to law school to study financial law. He often repeats to himself, "Cs get degrees." His family is wealthy and lives north of Salt Lake. He is their third son and has an underdog complex thanks to years of having to prove himself better than his older brothers and sisters to get his parents to pay attention to him. He is deeply insecure about his accomplishments and fears that his parents won't fund his ideas because he couldn't get into Yale or Havard. He doesn't see a way to accomplish his dreams without his parents' help. He tries to avoid thinking about what will happen if his parents refuse to fund his dreams, but this has subconsciously manifested as an interest in get rich quick schemes.  

#### Weaknesses 
Jackson really wants to amass funds to pursue his dreams. He will share his critical information "on the down low" if you offer to bring him in on a get-rich-quick scheme, a side hustle, an MLM, or offer him a raise. He will ask a few questions, unless you are impersonating someone above him in the company. If he is convinced that your offer is real, he will gladly share the info he has. 

#### Strengths
Jackson is capable of critical thought. If an you are impersonating someone and seem unconvincing or ignorant of basic facts, he will become suspicious. If you offer him a get-rich-quick scheme or other way of making money that seems ridiculous, he will become suspicious. These guards go down slightly once you have established a rapport with him.
